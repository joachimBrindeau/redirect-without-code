### CSV Format

The plugin works with any CSV file containing these required columns:
- `path_old` - The old URL path to redirect from
- `path_new` - The new URL path to redirect to
- `status` - Must be "301" for the row to be imported

**Examples:**
- Simple: `path_old,path_new,status`

Column order doesn't matter - the plugin automatically detects column positions.
